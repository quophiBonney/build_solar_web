                A hassle-free plan to enjoy solar without the cost of owning a

              <p>
                Solar power and battery storage don’t have to come at a premium.
                With utility rates and blackouts on the rise, you deserve
                control and confidence over your electricity. That’s why
                Sunrun’s monthly solar lease plan offers predictable rates while
                providing clean, affordable, resilient energy with little to no
                upfront costs. It includes our industry-leading Sunrun Solar
                Guarantee for maximum peace of mind. You can also add a solar
                battery to get protection during blackouts.
